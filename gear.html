			<p>Of course, one of the most important parts of every musician are the instruments they use.
			For example, back in the 80's, lots of artists used the Yamaha DX7 for their songs.
			It was pretty new and for me it defined a lot of the artist's overall sound. <br />
			Good examples for the DX7 are Tears for Fears and Nik Kershaw.

				<tr>
					<td>KORG monologue</td>
					<td>A versatile monophonic analogue synth, that can be used for basically any desired sound.
					Basses, acid-style leads or even improvised drum patches. It can do almost everything.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Yamaha PSR-640</td>
					<td>The Yamaha PSR-640 is a keyboard from the 90's. It has some interesting innovations built in,
					such as a so-called data dial for a different feeling.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Yamaha YPT-300</td>
					<td>I primarily use this keyboard for pad sounds since it isn't as powerfull as the PSR-640, 
					but still, I love its overall sound with the warmth.
					</td>
				<tr>
					<td>Marshall CODE 50</td>
					<td>A fully digital guitar amp with loads of effects and simulations of other amps.
